                <p id="introPara">"Hello World!" My name is Trey, Im a 26 year old software developer! My favorite language  would have to be java, as I enjoy working with that language the most, but C++ will always be my first!  I really enjoy the process of learning new programming technologies and environments because of the challenges that come with it! Some other interest I enjoy in my free time include all things fitness and gym related! I absolutely love working out! Lifting weights and going on runs get the endorphins going for me!  I like playing video games and hanging out with friends!  I believe its important to workout and challenge yourself physically, but challenging yourself mentally is just as important, and software development does exactly that for me!

                    <h3>Virtual Pet</h3>
                    <img src="images/virtualPet.png">
                    <p>This application allows the users to choose a virtual pet to care for! The pet has the ability to refuse food should it not want to eat.  The user is also able to display the pet's "vitals (how bored,how hungry, whether or not it need to use the bathroom etc) to the console" </p>

                    <h3>Donut Clicker</h3>
                    <img src="images/donutClicker.png">
                    <p>This web application mimics the web app cookies clicker with a donut theme.  I built this using html, css, and javaScript.  The user clickers the big donut button essentially to add to a donut counter.  There are options to buy autoclickers, multipliers, bakers, and bakeries.  The whole reasoning behind those options are simply to rack up more donuts faster without having to manually click the donut button.  With the autoclickers, bakers, and bakery options, their functionality works by a timer interval function...so after a set time period has passed they're activated automatically. Of course the more of those you have the faster your donut counter will imcrease!

                    <h3>Virtual Pet Amok</h3>
                    <img src="images/virtualPet_Amok.png">
                    <p>This application allows the user to interact with virtual pets that are in a shelter (collection: hash map).  Some pets are regular cats/dogs others are robotic cats/dogs.  That being said, I have immplemmented different ways in which these 2 types of pets are fed and hydrated.  Users have the ability to interact with all pets inside the shelter(hash map) at once by feeding, hydrating, playing with, etc, or a single pet at a time.  Users are also able to add a new pet into the shelter or adpot a pet out the shelter.  Both of those choices will result in the hash map shrinking or growing in size.  This project utilizes all 4 of the OOP pilars (abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation).
