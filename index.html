                <p id="introPara">"Hello World!" My name is Trey, Im a 26 year old software developer! My favorite language  would have to be java, as I enjoy working with that language the most, but C++ will always be my first!  I really enjoy the process of learning a new programming technologies and environments because of the challenge that comes with it! Some other interest I enjoy in my free time include all things fitness and gym related! I absolutely love working out! Lifting weights, or going on a run, is the best way get the endorphins going.  I like playing video games and hanging out with friends!  I believe its important to workout and challenge yourself physically, but challenging yourself mentally is just as important, and software development does exactly that for me!

                    Here are 3 projects I worked on in the past few months to showcase different skills i have aquired through my coding journey! These 3 particular projects essentially build off from the preivous; the first one being the least complex, and as you go on layers of complexity are added amoung the three!

                    <h3>Virtual Pet</h3>
                    <img src="images/virtualPet.png">
                    <p>This application allows the users to choose a virtual pet to care for! The pet has the ability to refuse food should it not want to eat.  The user is also able to display the pet's "vitals (how bored,how hungry, whether or not it need to use the bathroom etc) to the console" </p>

                    <h3>Virtual Pet Shelter</h3>
                    <img src="images/virtualPet_Shelter.png">
                    <p>This application adds a bit more complexity than the previous, in addition to all of the features of the previous app (interacting with the pet objects), with this one there are multiple pets within a collection (shelter) the user then is able to manipulate the collection and add more pet objects search for different pets to interact with
                    or even delete specific pet objects out of th collection.

                    <h3>Virtual Pet Amok</h3>
                    <img src="images/virtualPet_Amok.png">
                    <p>This application takes all the features of the previous two applications and adds the 4 pillars of OOP programing.Within the code I demostrate my knowledge of abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulaton.  The user is promptedto choose being a robotic or organic pet (in this case a cat or dog) to add into the shelter (collection: hashmap). Then from there the user is able to interact with each pet in specific ways pertaining to that type of pet.  example:  A robotic dog might only need to 
                    be walked and given more oil as opposed to a regular dog that needs to be given food and water as well as walked!
