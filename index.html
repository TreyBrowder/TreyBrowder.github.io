            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                Here are 3 projects I worked on in the past few months to showcase different skills i have 
                aquired through my coding journey! These 3 particular projects essentially build off from the preivous; the 
                first one being the least complex, and as you go on layers of complexity are added amoung the three!

                    <h3>Virtual Pet</h3>
                    <img src="images/virtualPet.png">
                    <p>This application allows the users to choose a virtual pet to care for! The pet has the ability 
                        to refuse food should it not want to eat.  The user is also able to display the pet's "vitals (how bored,
                        how hungry, whether or not it need to use the bathroom etc) to the console" </p>
                </article>

                    <h3>Virtual Pet Shelter</h3>
                    <img src="images/virtualPet_Shelter.png">
                    <p>This application adds a bit more complexity than the previous, in addition to all of the features of the 
                        previous app (interacting with the pet objects), with this one there are multiple pets within a collection (shelter) 
                        the user then is able to manipulate the collection and add more pet objects search for different pets to interact with
                        or even delete specific pet objects out of th collection.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Virtual Pet Amok</h3>
                    <img src="images/virtualPet_Amok.png">
                    <p>This application takes all the features of the previous two applications and adds the 4 pillars of OOP programing.
                        Within the code I demostrate my knowledge of abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulaton.  The user is prompted
                        to choose being a robotic or organic pet (in this case a cat or dog) to add into the shelter (collection: hashmap). Then from there 
                        the user is able to interact with each pet in specific ways pertaining to that type of pet.  example:  A robotic dog might only need to 
                        be walked and given more oil as opposed to a regular dog that needs to be given food and water as well as walked!
